My second gSchool project sprouted from my consistent interest in photo booths. Before moving to Boulder for gSchool,
my wife and owned a traveling photo booth with some friends. Creating and maintaining that booth and the technology is
something I miss dearly, so I wanted to create a photo booth that can be used by any one at any time, requiring only
and internet connect and a webcam. This is my feeble attempt at that.
